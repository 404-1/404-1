Hi, I'm V11ct0r (@404-1)

👀 I’m interested in mechanical and aerospace engineering.                                                                                                                                   
🌱 I’m currently learning MATLAB and deepening my Python skills.                                                                                                                             
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative engineering projects and breaking code.                                                                                                          
📫 How to reach me? That's an interesting question to be honest.                                                                                                                             
😄 I speak English and un peu de Francais.                                                                                                                                                   
⚡ Fun fact: I've been doing more googling and AI prompting than coding.
